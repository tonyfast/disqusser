# Bio-Design workshop

_March 25 from noon to 5, Lunch included._

Bio inspired materials: function and design, fabrication and advanced manufacturing, scaling and sustainable practices.
Workshop sponsored by the Institute of Materials

# Goals

1. To identify complementary research expertise and abilities that could be applied to an effort in Biological Materials and Bio Inspired Materials Design. 
2. To attempt to meet April 30 deadline of DARPA/BTO: http://www.darpa.mil/Opportunities/Solicitations/BTO_Solicitations.aspx. 
3. To consider a biological materials and design center at GT: From a review of the landscape of biologically inspired design, there seem to be few institutes with a focus on biological materials and bio inspired materials design. There are many innovative scientists/engineers at different universities doing high caliber work in this area.
